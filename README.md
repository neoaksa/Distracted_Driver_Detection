# Distracted_Driver_Detection
Distracted Driver images are from kaggle competiton which you can find detail [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection#description).

Basicly, the data alrealy labeled into 10 different statues, from C0 to C9.

- c0: normal driving
- c1: texting - right
- c2: talking on the phone - right
- c3: texting - left
- c4: talking on the phone - left
- c5: operating the radio
- c6: drinking
- c7: reaching behind
- c8: hair and makeup
- c9: talking to passenger

we know it is a supervised learning problem and there are bunch of solutions for this problem in kaggle. But I still want to implent it as I need to build a standard pipline for this kind of issue and try variety model by keras to achieve the best result basis of multi-class logarithmic loss.
